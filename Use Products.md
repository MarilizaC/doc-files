# Use Products ![Environments icon](https://github.com/MarilizaC/icons/blob/master/Icon-Peers.png) 

Choose from among the available products, plugins and blueprints, that can be installed in your environment to run the web or cloud application that you want. Every now and then, check for new products from your fellow users within the Subutai community.

After setting up a peer and environment, you can start installing a product. You must have at least one active peer to install and use a blueprint or plugin. For plugins, you need to create your own peer. For blueprints, you can set them up in a new environment, which can be created along with the build.

## How to install a blueprint
1. On the Products page, click the Application Blueprints tab.
2. Click the name or logo of the blueprint to open its details page.
