# How to Create and Use Environments ![Environments icon](https://github.com/MarilizaC/icons/blob/master/Icon-Environments.png) 

An environment needs at least one active peer on which to run. You can lease or rent another user’s peer or you can use your own peer. 

The following instructions show you how to create an environment from the Subutai Bazaar. Be sure that you are logged in to the Bazaar with your account credentials, and with the PGP key configured in the Account settings. To do so, use the E2E Plugin for your specific browser. For more information about this plugin, see the companion software section at [Getting Started](https://subutai.io/getting-started.html#E2E).

To create an environment:
1. On the Environment page, click Create Environment.
2. On the Select Peers screen, check the box for the peer that suits your environment, and then click Next.

  :bulb: **``Tip``** | If none of the peers are suitable, click the “search for other peers” link to select one from the Peers list.
3. On the Select Templates screen, select one from the Templates list on the right side.
Containers are assigned to templates starting from the top left, in a clockwise direction. 
  
  :pencil: **``Note``** | If you have your own template, upload it on the CDN tool first before you can select it here. For more information, see [Subutai CDN](https://docs.subutai.io/Products/Bazaar/10_CDN.html?highlight=cdn). If you are going to install a blueprint on the environment, refer to the [Writing Subutai Blueprints](https://github.com/subutai-blueprints/hackathon/wiki/Writing-Subutai-Blueprints) article for information about using custom templates.
4. Click the + icon for each container to configure the following properties:
- **Size** - Select the size: Tiny, Small, Medium, Huge. For information about container sizes, see [What is GoodWill](https://github.com/subutai-blueprints/hackathon/wiki/What-is-%22GoodWill%22).
- **Name** - Enter the container name.
5. Click Save to close the container properties, and then click Apply.
