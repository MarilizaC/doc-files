## About the Subutai Open Source Project

In 2013, OptDyn was founded to start the Subutai open source project, which aimed at creating a peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud and fog computing platform called Subutai. What followed were software and hardware products built to improve and enhance the Subutai ecosystem. For details about the project, see [Subutai Open Source Project](https://docs.subutai.io/About.html#subutai-the-open-source-project).

![Subutai Open Source Project Timeline](https://github.com/MarilizaC/doc-files/blob/master/subutai_timeline.png)

The Subutai software and Subutai Router hardware are both 100% free and open, both being licensed under the business friendly Apache Software License v2.0. 

Check out the various ways of getting involved with the project:
- **Contribute to the Subutai Cloud**
- **Earn GoodWill**
- **Join the Community**

### Contribute to the Subutai Cloud
<p align="center"><i>There are many ways to contribute to the Subutai crowd cloud or, </br> shall we say, many ways to join the horde! </i></p> 

**Start using Subutai.** Use Subutai to start renting or sharing your computing resources. With PeerOS, you can create peers and fire them up using Subutai Vagrant boxes. Once up and running, register them with Bazaar where other users and renters can select them according to their requirements.   

For renters or users, you can increase your computing power, choose from the available peers, and start installing the applications that you need. Several open source applications can be readily installed and set up in no time. If you want, you can also host them on your own peer to gain access online from anywhere. This alone will feel empowering.  

**Give feedback.** We welcome your feedback! Tell us how we can improve the user experience for everyone. Your helpful feedback, suggestions, and comments are extremely valuable to us.  

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/MarilizaC/doc-files/blob/master/subutai_globe.png"> Plus, we want to light up that globe at [Subutai Bazaar](https://bazaar.subutai.io/login). With peers all around the world, the power of the P2P cloud community increases. </p> 

Connect with us on [Subutai Slack](https://slack.subutai.io) to contribute or discuss your ideas.

**Help design the P2P cloud sharing economy.** The design of this economy is always a work in progress. Join us in building an economy around GoodWill, a digital asset generated by good deeds, primarily by providing resources to others. We’re trying to model something intangible in a concrete way, when it comes to collaborative consumption in the cloud crowd. Eventually, GoodWill itself will be exchanged for cryptocurrencies as a Smart Token. We want to make sure that we get this right and keep improving it, going forward. All of these happen within the community, not in a vacuum.

The design of the economy is something we’re adamant about making community-driven. We have started with the basic Service Level Agreements (SLAs), however, we know that people will find all sorts of exceptions and scenarios we have never thought of before. This is a new world and we are excited by what we’re going to find.  

**Contribute Blueprints.** One-click cloud application installation is critical. Users from all walks of life should be able to launch an application in their own cloud, with the same ease in which they install an iPhone application from the AppStore. Bridging this gap between non-technical users and open source products is crucial for the success of open source in the cloud era. Subutai Blueprints were designed to make open source cloud applications easy to install and use for mass consumption.

For developers, a Blueprint is a simple JSON based templating format. Use blueprints to fire up application stacks within environments or build environments using your favorite DevOps tools for automation. Subutai Blueprints support Ansible and other tools out of the box. Contributors who create blueprints that are made freely available on Bazaar may qualify for GoodWill promotions. *[Get started today!](https://github.com/subutai-blueprints/hackathon/wiki/Writing-Subutai-Blueprints)*

**Get involved.** Developers and engineers are welcome to contribute! We need Ethereum blockchain and Solidity savvy engineers, P2P researchers to help us experiment and optimize DHT and Gossip protocols. We need C/C++, Java, Javascript, Golang programmers. If you want to get involved as a developer, first *[give Subutai a try](https://subutai.io/getting-started.html)* as a user. Then, take a look at our list of *[GitHub projects](https://github.com/subutai-io/)* to get an idea of which area you could focus on. Come onto our *[Slack channel](https://slack.subutai.io)* and let us know if you need help diving in. We’re here and waiting for you! Register on the *[Subutai Bazaar](https://bazaar.subutai.io/login)*, and we’ll give you some GoodWill to trade cloud resources with others on the system.
