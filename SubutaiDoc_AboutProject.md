## About the Subutai Open Source Project

In 2013, OptDyn was founded to start the Subutai open source project, which aimed at creating a peer-to-peer (P2P) cloud and fog computing platform called Subutai. What followed were software and hardware products built to improve and enhance the Subutai ecosystem. For details about the project, see [Subutai Open Source Project](https://docs.subutai.io/About.html#subutai-the-open-source-project).
