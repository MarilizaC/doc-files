A peer is a single Subutai node with management services (management host containers) and at least one local resource host that contributes resources to be shared.

On the Peers page, view the list of existing peers that you can set up in your environment. To view your own peers, click My Peers to display the list on the User details side of the Bazaar. 

### Search for peers
Use the Search tool to look for a peer by its partial or full name. You can also use the filters at the top of the page to narrow down the list of peers.
