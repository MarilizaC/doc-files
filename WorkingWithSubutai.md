## Get Started
There are different ways to get started using Subutai, whether you want to set up peers and rent your computing resources or you want to look for available resources to rent.

#### :beginner: Create a Bazaar account
Users who want to rent computing resources or those who are new to the Subutai platform could start with the basic Bazaar account. In Bazaar, check out the available peers and apps, like Blueprints or plugins that you can use. Create environments where you can set up and access those apps. Create your account now

#### :beginner: Create and run peers
Peer owners or administrators can get started by doing a quick install of the PeerOS and getting a peer running in no time. Your journey begins here

#### :beginner: Use a Subutai Blueprint
Use enhanced templates that we call “Blueprints” that are designed to create cloud environments and install applications at the same time. Using blueprints is a quick way of deploying applications in a cloud environment, on a peer that you own or rent from another user. Check our growing collection of Blueprints: file hosting - Nextcloud; CMS - WordPress, Grav; smart contract development - Blockchain-in-a-Box; gaming - Minecraft Server, and others.

#### :beginner: Install the software components
Peer owners, managers, and administrators can start using the software components built to easily access and manage peers, environments, and containers.
