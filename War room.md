Get yourself armed with the latest Bazaar statistics and related data in the War Room. The War Room is the place to meet to fill in the peer gaps on the global map. It allows you to monitor the P2P economy and work together to ensure its growth. You can interact with other users and suggest features that you believe will improve the Bazaar experience.

### Globe
The dynamic globe represents real-time distribution of peers and users around the world.
