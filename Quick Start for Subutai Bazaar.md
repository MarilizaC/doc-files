# Quick Start for Subutai Bazaar
This guide contains the initial procedures for setting up a Subutai Bazaar account. If you need more information about the Bazaar, see [Subutai Bazaar](https://subutai.io/bazaar.html).

## Create a Subutai Bazaar account
Ready to join and experience the Bazaar? Follow the steps below to register and set up your Bazaar account:

1. To access Subutai Bazaar, go to https://bazaar.subutai.io.
2. Enter your email address on the Sign up tab. 

   You will receive an email with the confirmation link.
3. Confirm your registration by clicking the email link.
4. On the Sign up form, enter your username, full name, and password, and then click Save.

   Once logged in, take the tour or explore Bazaar on your own. On certain pages, when asked to set up your PGP key, you have to do so for authentication purposes. For procedures on authentication, see [Installing the E2E plugin](#install-the-e2e-browser-plugin).
   
## Install the E2E browser plugin
In Bazaar, when asked to set up a PGP key, you may set up one manually or use the E2E browser plugin. The plugin helps you generate PGP keys, manage them, and keep them secure. For more information about the plugin, see [E2E Plugin](https://docs.subutai.io/Products/Bazaar/27_E2E_plugin.html).

To install the E2E browser plugin:
1. Download and add the E2E plugin for your browser through the links below:
   - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subutai-e2e-plugin/)
   - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subutai-e2e-plugin/ffddnlbamkjlbngpekmdpnoccckapcnh)
   - For other supported browsers, go to [E2E Browser Plugins](https://github.com/subutai-io/browser-plugins)
   After adding the plugin, you will be prompted to generate the key.
2. On the Generate key popup, enter your email address, and then click Generate.

3. On the plugin page, click the ![Info icon](https://github.com/MarilizaC/icons/blob/master/InstallE2E%20-%20icon.png)  icon to access the key.
4. In the Fingerprint field, copy the entire key.

   If you are not logged in to Subutai Bazaar, you can do so now to set up the key.
5. On the Bazaar page, click your account name located at the upper right corner.

   This displays the Account settings popup. 

   :pencil: **``Note``** | In case you have the Set PGP key message displayed, click the link to access Account settings.
6. On Account settings, paste the PGP key in the PGP Key fingerprint field, and then click Upload.

   7. Click Save. 

   :pencil: **``Note``** | If you encounter an error when entering or saving this key, you can delete it from the plugin page, and then generate a new key. You only need one PGP key for your Bazaar account.
   
Once you get authenticated, you can now start setting up cloud environments, using blueprints, or sharing your projects with other users or within groups. Get more information about the blueprints, find out how to get involved, or earn GoodWill:
